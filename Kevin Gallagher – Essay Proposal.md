## Title: Instagram is Making You Miserable

## Research Question: Are social media platforms causing young people to be miserable?

## Introduction (402)

Instagram serves as a platform where we can share our personal moments. The holiday we took to sunny Marbella with our best friends, videos of our pets because we know this clip of Fluffy sneezing is adorable, or even the fancy meal served on slates you had when you went out for your Grandparents 50th anniversary.

These moments are overwhelmingly positive. In these cases Instagram becomes a place where we feel happy, we share a laugh with friends and save cherished memories we want to keep forever.

But, have you ever felt the insecurity that comes before every post, when you’re double thinking over how you present yourself on social media? 
Have you felt the dread, scrolling through a few hundreds of the almost identical photos from the amateur photo shoot in your family living room? All in search for the perfect pic? 
Have you maybe felt that your life isn’t living up to the standards set in front of you, by your friends and idols alike on Instagram?

The more that I use social media, such as Instagram, the more I feel I should be doing with the time I have. My life doesn’t seem half as exciting as the people I follow. It’s in times like this that my feelings of anxiety begin to outweigh the positive feelings I have for these social media platforms.

However, these are just a few personal and possibly relatable examples of how these anxiety-filled moments are making their way into my life as a user of social media. 

Through this essay, my goal is to research how social media and in particular Instagram have been affecting the mental health and behaviours of average young people. These are the people in the developed western world that have grown up alongside the growth of the internet and the birth of social media. Therefore the age range I am most interested in researching is from ages 14 to 25.  

I want to find out what studies have been taken looking into this issue of how social media is affecting our moods. I’ll explore the key facts and figures to show the depth of this issue.  I will also be looking into leading companies and the products they have out there, and in development, that will help us to move forward alongside social media with its positives, all the while releasing ourselves of the social pressures of its negatives.


## Section 1: The Figures.

The purpose of this section is to show the facts and get a better understanding of how many people are suffering from anxiety and depression in the UK. It is also to show how as a society we are spending much more time on our smartphones and on social media. It is also important to realise that due to the hidden nature of mental wellbeing is one which is hard to quantify, therefore the data may not reflect the extent of the impact social media has.

According to a study by the Mental Health Foundation from 2016, there were 8.2 million new cases of Anxiety between 2013 and 2014, show an increase of 1.5%. 19.7% of all people in the UK 16 and over have shown symptoms of anxiety and depression. The percentage was higher for just woman at 22.5%. 

Our increase in social media use is apparent when looking into the results of the GlobalWebIndex survey in 2017. In 2012, digital consumers had an average of 3 accounts, but by 2016, this average had risen to 7 social media accounts, with the average time of 116 minutes daily spent on social media by 2017.

A UK survey of 14-24 year-olds, on their well-being around social media, was conducted by a charity, the Royal Society for Public Health(RSPH). Their goal was to find out how the most popular social media platforms have affected everything from sleep quality to FoMO, the fear of missing out. Instagram scored lowest for its effects on sleep, body image and FoMO. Snapchat came close in its overall negativity, however, was saved by its positive effects on building relationships.

## Section 2: /* Exploring the Fiction? */

I will be focusing on Instagram in this section as it was reported by the RSPH survey that 63 percent of its users have felt miserable when using it. I hope to understand why Instagram may be damaging users self-esteems and harm to its user mental health. 

First, I will be looking at the idealistic lives of those we follow and like on Instagram. Their lives make most peoples seem so dull in comparison. We may be feeling we are missing out on the parties, the family time and the holidays, but much of this is fiction. 

There is money to be made from sponsors on Instagram. According to Forbes in 2016, an Instagram user with 100,000 followers can be paid $5,000 for a post made in partnership with a company or brand. This relatively low in comparison to what high-end celebrities who could be making $150,000 for an Instagram post alone.

For celebrities, they are literally being paid to feature the use of luxury products in their posts. It is understandable that we then begin to judge our own self-worth with having these high-end products and most times these goals can be unreachable.

But is it the social media or the tech habits that are the cause of our anxieties? Psychologist Dr. Aaron Montgomery in an interview with Forcefield said “Social media sites like Instagram and Facebook are not necessarily good or bad. Their value lies in how they are used and who is using them,”. I feel like this is important to take into account as it reminds us that social media is just a tool

In the book The Shallows by Nicholas Carr, it mentions that our increased use of technology, in general, could be a cause for increased anxiety in our society. I feel like this would be an interesting alternative opinion for the increase in anxiety rates. It also explains that we are drawn to smaller amounts of information.  As stated by Fred R. Barnard, 'A picture is worth ten thousand words', this could be the reason why we are moving to Instagram and Snapchat for their 10-second stories and easily digestible information.

## Section 3: /* Gaining Prospective? */

There are positives to using social media and I don't believe we all should be rushing to abandon social media altogether. Again in the RSPH survey, it tells us the top 5 social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and Snapchat, all received positive scores for self-identity, self-expression, community building, and emotional support. Platforms like YouTube have brought awareness to issues of mental health through its creators coming forward and speaking to young adults and teens in their communities. I strongly believe this to be a positive as they provide access to information for people struggling with mental health issues as if it were coming from a trusted friend.

RSPH is calling for social media companies to make changes. 71% said they’d support an introduction of a “heavy usage” warning within these apps or websites. Just this year Apple has come out with Screen Time in iOS 12. Apple Screen Time serves as a data collector for how we spend our precious time on our Apple devices. It also has a feature where you can limit the amount of time you spend on apps and at what time of day you are unable to use certain apps past. I feel like this is a good place to begin and a way of keeping on track with a healthy amount of time spent on social media.

### Conclusion

I think we all can agree that there are pressures to put your ‘best self’ on social media and that this could be a factor in increasing rates of anxiety and depression, however, I hope that through this essay we realise that this issue is not being ignored. Moving on I feel like social media and its ‘stars’ will be viewed much like as we view ‘reality’ TV  and it stars, as an exaggerated fiction of produced real-life moments and people, made for entertainment purposes.

Twenge’s analysis is the use of compelling large-scale age-matched generational data comparing Gen-Z now to previous generations when they were the age that Gen-Z is now.  This allows for a genuine comparison and removes general traits associated with youth.
