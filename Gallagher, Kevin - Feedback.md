The title and question are fine and the question is interesting. I wonder would 'the young' be better than 'youths'.

Opening sentence: "…and **in** particular…." Read aloud and you'll spot issues like this.

What are 'average young people'? That's a bit of a vague term. You need to define it a little more. What is average? Do you mean all young people, just young people in more affluent, western societies? If you tease this out more you end up zoning in on the audience a little more.

You say it's your opinion that people in the age range you mention are more affected, but I'd like you to expand on that a little. Don't older people find Instagram is making them miserable? (I'm 48 and I find it sometimes makes me miserable.)

I think getting to the root of these questions will help you get more to the heart of the point you're making. For example, there's a general sense of life being unfair on younger generations (the baby boomers have all the money, younger generations are struggling, etc.). Tease this out perhaps, because it add to the weight that the age range you mention are experiencing.

The Section 1 title 'The Figures' doesn't really tell me what this section is about. It's about mental health so try and choose a title for the section that echoes that.

There are a lot of figures in this section – which is great – but you might break them down a little, use a list, for example for the second paragraph of section one. That would make everything easier to parse. (I linked to an NNg report on writing for the web in my guidance, that would be worth looking at.)

This section would make for some great diagrams for your final essay.

"I will be looking at the idealistic lives…." I'd add the word 'supposedly' here, or similar: "I will be looking at the supposedly idealistic lives…." It gives a clearer sense of where you're going. That said, this section is where it really takes off and I'm looking forward to reading more on this.

100,000 followers equals $5,000 for a post… goodness!

You then go on to say this is relatively low, but if you unpack this I think there's an interesting story. Getting to 100,000 followers means selling a 'fiction' and there's an incentive – financial – to sugarcoat your life.

This needs to be unpacked more, because it's the interesting aspect of the essay. What you have is a good start, I'm looking forward to hearing more as you expand on it. This needs work because Section 2 is important to your overall argument and – at present – it jumps around a little. All interesting, but ask yourself: What is the key point of Section 2, then tease that out.

When you mention a title, for example, 'The Shallows' you need either quotes around it or you need to italicise it.

Your conclusion starts to get at the heart of the issue: That we look at reality stars on TV as a fiction and – soon? – may do the same with reality stars in other media. This is a really important point, you just need to get more of it into the main body.

A solid start!
